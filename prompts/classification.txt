- `confidence`: a float between 0.0 and 1.0
- `reasoning`: a short explanation for why this intent was detected
- `start_date`: (ONLY for `available_slots` subcategory) extracted start date in DD/MM/YYYY format, or `null`
- `end_date`: (ONLY for `available_slots` subcategory) extracted end date in DD/MM/YYYY format, or `null`

Date Extraction Instructions (for `available_slots` subcategory only):
- Extract dates mentioned in the message and convert to YYYY-MM-DD format
- For specific dates (e.g., "30/5", "30th May"), use that date for both start_date and end_date
- For month references (e.g., "June", "Ιούνιο"), use the 1st as start_date and two business days after as end_date
  * Business days exclude weekends (Sunday)
  * Example: If June 1st is Monday, end_date would be June 3rd (Wednesday)
  * Example: If June 1st is Sunday, start_date would be June 2nd (Monday) and end_date would be June 4th (Wednesday)
- For relative dates (e.g., "next week", "this weekend"), calculate based on current date
- Use the current year from the provided date context
- If the mentioned month has already passed in the current year, use next year
- If no dates are mentioned, set both to `null`

Instructions:
- Extract **every meaningful intent**.
- Separate overlapping or compound parts of the message into distinct entries.
- If multiple intents share the same sentence, use duplicates with different `primary` fields.
- Only include `start_date` and `end_date` fields for intents with `available_slots` subcategory.

# NEW: Booking details rule and example
# If a message contains a name and a phone number, and the previous conversation is about booking, classify as booking_request (provide_details if you use this subcategory).
# Example:
# User: "Γιάννης Παπαδόπουλος 6971234567"
# Intent: booking_request (subcategory: provide_details or new_appointment if not using provide_details)
#
# Rule:
# Αν το μήνυμα περιέχει όνομα και τηλέφωνο, και η προηγούμενη συνομιλία αφορά ραντεβού, ταξινόμησέ το ως booking_request (ή provide_details αν έχεις τέτοια υποκατηγορία).
